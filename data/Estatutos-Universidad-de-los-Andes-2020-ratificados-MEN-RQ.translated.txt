## OF THE FOUNDERS


“Those who only do for their fellow humans what the law obliges them to do are not fulfilling their duties properly, nor are they good citizens, nor do they deserve the esteem and respect of others.” “For human coexistence to be true and sincere, the development of human intelligence and its vigilant application to the study and solution of the multiple problems of existence is indispensable.” “It is every individual's obligation to reconcile the interests that come between the individual and the community, in accordance with the principles of moral truth and reason, humbly inclining before the truth and justice, the unique and eternal foundations of all existence that realizes the innate capacity for perfection that exists in the human being.”
